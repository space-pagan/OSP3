Compilation:
	The Makefile for this project will create the following:
		bin/oss
		bin/oss_child
	
		The default recipe 'make' will build both of these executables.
		'make clean' will delete obj/ and bin/, including all files within
		'make cleanrun' will delete bin/*.out and bin/*.log

Running the program:
	oss [-c x] [-t z] [-l log] [-h]
		-c x	Sets the maximum number of concurrent child processes.
					defaults to 5, Hard-limited to 20

		-t z	Sets the timeout period. After z seconds have passed, oss
					and all child processes will be terminated.
					defaults to 20
                    
        -l log  Sets the output log file for the program. If the file exists,
                    output is appended to the log. If the file does not exist
                    oss will create the file with the provided name. If no
                    log is specified, the program will present an error
                    message and terminate

        -h      Prints the manpage-styled internal help dialogue

Version Control:
	This project's version control has been managed under git. For a log of
	modifications, use 'git log', and its various options.

Outstanding Problems:
	None, to my knowledge.

Encountered Difficulties:
    None worth mentionining

Bugtesting efforts:
	Various combinations of CLI arguments to test CLI Parsing
    Various options to -c x to test concurrency and mutual exclusion
    Program always completes in under 1 second so testing of automated
        timeout is impractical without introducing sleep() calls

	Everything appears to work without issue.
